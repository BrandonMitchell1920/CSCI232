# Assignment: Classes and Inheritance
## F20 CSCI 232 Data Structures and Algorithms
### Assigned: 2020-08-26; Due Date: 2020-09-03 (Midnight); Reference: CPPI-1

_Lab Environment_

The course lab and project environment is a Linux virtual machine. The machine name is `lumen.cs.mtech.edu`. You may access this virtual machine using any available `ssh` (secure shell) client software. One Microsoft Windows-10, you can open a command window and use the built-in `ssh` client software:

Press the `Windows Key` and type `cmd` and then hit `enter`

in the command window, you should then type,

`ssh pcurtiss@lumen.cs.mtech.edu`

and it `enter`, where `pcurtiss` is replaced with your username. Your username is first part of your email address, stripped of any trailing numbers. 

You will then be challenged for your password, which you will not see as you type the characters of your password for the sake of privacy. Your password is whatever you changed it to in `CSCI136` or your student ID if your password has been reset by your instructor. 

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be presented with your Linux prompt. The default prompt from the system will look something similar to the following: 

`pcurtiss@lumen: ~$`

_Forking Today's Lab Repository_

On the top menu bar you should see a `Projects` pull-down menu toward the left. `Left-click` on this pull-down menu and select `Your Projects` to see a list of projects to which you have access, as well as your own projects - projects in your own `GitLab` account. One of these projects should look something like the following:

```
Data Structures and Algorithms / F20 CSCI232 / Lab02 Boxes
```

This project, to which you have access, is in the course (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository for this term's (F20 CSCI232) offering. In order to be able to modify and work with the files in this repository you must get a copy of this project into your own account on `GitLab`. Making a remote copy from one account on `GitLab` to another account on `GitLab` is called `forking`. 

To fork today's lab repository, `left-click` on the the course project shown above. This will show you a summary of the project, with some of the files shown in a details list, but at the top, to the right of the project name, you should see a few buttons - [A bell icon], [A star icon], and a [Fork] button. `Left-click` on the `fork` button and then select your account as the destination account into which to place the `forked` copy of the project repository - it will take a few minutes for the fork to complete. 

Once completed, you will notice that you are placed in the project contents, but at the top left, the path now looks like,

```
jqpublic / Lab02 Boxes 
```

or similar, with our username in the path. This indicates the remote repository has been copied into your account. 

The next step is to add your instructor (and any TAs) as members to this project so they can see the project contents, review the project, and provide a grade for your work. The menu on the left should have a `Members` item. `Left-click` the `Members` menu item on the left and you should be presented with a form. Make sure the `Invite Members` tab at the top is selected and then enter your instructor's (and any TA's) name or email in the `GitLab member or Email address` form field. When you have added the instructor (and any TAs) to this field, `left-click` on the `Choose a role permission` and select `Developer` from the options; you should leave the `Access expiration date` blank. Then `left-click` the `invite` button to add them as members to the project. 

Lastly, `left-click` on the `Project Overview` item in the left menu to display the project information. To the right should be a `blue` button labeled `clone`. `left-click` this button and select the `copy url clipboard` icon to the right of the `ssh` url item to copy the url to the workstation's clipboard. 

_Obtaining Project Files_

Now you are ready to copy the remote project repository for today's lab from your account on the `GitLab` server to your account on `lumen.cs.mtech.edu`. 

Switch back to the Linux window and type the following: 

```
cd ~/CSCI232/Labs
git clone git@gitlab.cs.mtech.edu:pcurtiss/f20/Lab02-Boxes.git
```

where the specific url is from you pasting the `ssh url` into the window that you copied in your lab step from working with the `GitLab` server - the one shown above is just an example. When you hit `enter` you will be challenged for the passphrase you used when you created your `ssh` key. Enter this passphrase and hit `enter`. Git will now clone (or copy) the remote project repository from your account on `GitLab` to a local repository in your account on `lumen.cs.mtech.edu` and link the two repositories, such that as you make changes to your local repository, you can `push` these changes back to the remote repository as needed, to update the shared (with your instructor and any TAs) repository on the `GitLab` server. 

Once the `clone` has completed, you should have a new (sub)directory in your `~/CSCI232/Labs` directory named `Lab02-Boxes`, which you can see by using the `ls` command. 

_Completing the Lab Activities_

As you work through the specific activities for this Lab, you will be asked questions, or to provide information from the environment. This information should be collected in a lab report in a file named `report.pdf` that is included in the `Lab02-Boxes` directory. You may make this file in word and then store a PDF and upload (using `scp`) to your `lumen.cs.mtech.edu` account. If you are unsure how to do this, ask the instructor or a TA. 

Please perform the following activities in the completion of the lab assignment: 

1. Your lab has four (4) parts - three of which are explored in the lab with you. The last part - the `SumBox` - is what you will need to create. 
1. In each part you can build with the `make` command and then execute what you have built using `./driver` program. Please study these files and review and understand the code. If there is code that is confusing to you, bring this up in class so we can discuss and resolve the confusion. 
1. You will need to extend the `ToyBox` to have the `setColor()` method with the correct prototype signature and implementation.
1. You will then need to finish the `SumBox`. This box keeps a running total (of integers) every time you add an integer value to the Box using the `setItem()` method. If the current value in the Box is a positive number (or zero), then the `SumBox` color should be set to `BLACK`. If the current value in the Box is less than zero, then the `SumBox` color should be set to `RED`.
1. You will need to implement the `setItem()` method of the `SumBox`. 
1. Once finished, build your lab using the `make` command and then execute your lab using the `./driver` command. What is the output? Include the output in your lab report.

_Editing Your Lab Project Files_

You may edit your program files either locally, on the Linux system, or remotely, using any number of remote file system schemes. The method selected varies widely depending on your preference. 

To edit locally, on the Linux system, you should use either `nano` or `vim`. Both of these are powerful editors for working with different source code files. To edit a file with nano, you would type, 

```
nano driver.cpp
``` 

for example. You can follow the commands at the bottom of the `nano` window to manipulate the file. I have also included a cheat-sheet for `vim` if you would prefer to use that editor. 

If you are interested in remote editing your files, please see the instructor, a course TA, or a Museum Lab TA for assistance.
