For the report.txt, I am just going to run this a bunch of times and show the 
output.  I will show what will cause errors and what it will say to the user
if they have that issue.  I will also explain a few things.  Since parsing is 
really the most difficult and important part of this assignment, most of this
report will be showing the parsing and how it can catch a variety of problems

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Here I test the invalid characters.  Note that capital letters are invalid as 
that is what the assignment stated to do, but it would be very easy to include
them.

Please give infix expression: a * 5.5 - 3! * (a--4)

Check the parentheses, pretty simple as we done it before in class.  Note I
don't print the index of extra open parentheses because I don't currently have
access to its index and I didn't want to walk back through to figure out which
one is the problem.

An about three hundred line loop to verify the infix structure and spat out 
warnings to the user about what is the problem.  Some code is similar and is 
repeated, but often it is just enought different that putting it in a function
would be more of a pain.  First I check ops, then variables, numbers, and then
decimals.  The former three also verify parentheses to some degree.

I also have a check comparing the number of operators to operands.  Since all 
operators are sandwiched in two operands, the number of operators should be one
less than the operands.  This was mainly added as I changed some error checking
code above so one error would be prefered over the other, but it meant this 
error could get through.

Please give infix expression: ()-a * 4
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'PrecondViolatedExcep'
  what():  Precondition Violated Exception:
Invalid number of operators compared to operands, "2" compared to "2",
should be one less operators compared to operands, make sure all operators are balanced
()-a * 4

Finally, let's show it working on all manner of input.  Note that negative 
numbers are allowed, but the negative will have to be a part of the number and 
right at the front, or it will error.  I will start with some simple examples
that can easily be verfied as correct by the user and then I will do some more
complicated ones.  It wouldn't be too difficult to add support for unary 
operators on variables since it would be similar to negative numbers.  Also,
variables of two or more characters woundn't be too difficult to implement as
well.

Note that the postfix equivalnts have 0 added to the front of decimals and have
spaces between them.  This just makes it easier to parse once again for 
evaluation and makes it look nicer.
