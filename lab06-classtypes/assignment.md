# Assignment: Class Relationships in C++
## F20 CSCI 232 Data Structures and Algorithms
### Assigned: 2020-09-30; Due Date: 2020-10-23 (Midnight); Reference: CPPI-5

### Project Description

This lab pertains to understanding and exploring the different possible relationships between C++ classes. Specifically, how class inheritance modifiers of the base class function to effect different levels of access to private and protected members of the base class and the access available to clients using instances of a concrete class from such an inheritance tree. 

You will be using the `Boxes` again, but this time creating a class inheritance structure to create a new kind of Box, `BoxContainer`, that holds another (nested) box, by making use of (a) polymorphism using the BoxInterface, and (2) using nested templates - you have already used a nested template when working with Smart Pointers. Each box can hold a single `Item` of a templated type, but can also contain a single (nested) Box as well. 

You would need to create a traversal method that opens one box after the other, ultimately displaying the item contained in the non-nested box.

_Lab Environment_

The course lab and project environment is a Linux virtual machine. The machine name is `lumen.cs.mtech.edu`. You may access this virtual machine using any available `ssh` (secure shell) client software. On Microsoft Windows-10, you can open a command window and use the built-in `ssh` client software:

Press the `Windows Key` and type `cmd` and then hit `enter`

in the command window, you should then type,

`ssh pcurtiss@lumen.cs.mtech.edu`

and hit `enter`, where `pcurtiss` is replaced with your own username. Your username is first part of your email address, stripped of any trailing numbers. 

You will then be challenged for your password, which you will not see as you type, for the sake of privacy. Your password is whatever you changed it to in `CSCI136` or your student ID if your password has been reset by your instructor. 

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be presented with your Linux prompt. The default prompt from the system will look something similar to the following: 

`pcurtiss@lumen: ~$`

_Forking Today's Lab Repository_

Open a web browser on your workstation and enter [https://gitlab.cs.mtech.edu](https://gitlab.cs.mtech.edu) into the location field, then login to `GitLab` using the credentials you selected upon initial account setup.

On the top menu bar of your account page you should see a `Projects` pull-down menu toward the left. `Left-click` on this pull-down menu and select `Your Projects` to see a list of projects to which you have access, as well as your own projects - projects in your own `GitLab` account. One of these projects should look something like the following:

```
Data Structures and Algorithms / F20 CSCI232 / Lab06 ClassTypes
```

This project, to which you have access, is in the course (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository for this term's (F20 CSCI232) offering. In order to be able to modify and work with the files in this repository you must get a copy of this project into your own account on `GitLab`. Making a remote copy from one account on `GitLab` to another account on `GitLab` is called `forking`. 

To fork today's lab repository, `left-click` on the the course project shown above. This will show you a summary of the project, with some of the files shown in a details list, but at the top, to the right of the project name, you should see a few buttons - [A bell icon], [A star icon], and a [Fork] button. `Left-click` on the `fork` button and then select your account as the destination account into which to place the `forked` copy of the project repository - it will take a few minutes for the fork to complete. 

Once completed, you will notice that you are placed in the project contents, but at the top left, the path now looks like,

```
jqpublic / Lab06 ClassTypes
```

or similar, with our username in the path. This indicates the remote repository has been copied into your account. 

The next step is to add your instructor (and any TAs) as members to this project so they can see the project contents, review the project, and provide a grade for your work. The menu on the left should have a `Members` item. `Left-click` the `Members` menu item on the left and you should be presented with a form. Make sure the `Invite Members` tab at the top is selected and then enter your instructor's (and any TA's) name or email in the `GitLab member or Email address` form field. When you have added the instructor (and any TAs) to this field, `left-click` on the `Choose a role permission` and select `Developer` from the options; you should leave the `Access expiration date` blank. Then `left-click` the `invite` button to add them as members to the project. 

Lastly, `left-click` on the `Project Overview` item in the left menu to display the project information. To the right should be a `blue` button labeled `clone`. `left-click` this button and select the `copy url clipboard` icon to the right of the `ssh` url item to copy the url to the workstation's clipboard. 

_Obtaining Project Files_

Now you are ready to copy the remote project repository for today's lab from your account on the `GitLab` server to your account on `lumen.cs.mtech.edu`. 

Switch back to the Linux window and type the following: 

```
cd ~/CSCI232/Labs
git clone git@gitlab.cs.mtech.edu:pcurtiss/f20/Lab06-ClassTypes.git
```

where the specific url is from you pasting the `ssh url` into the window that you copied in your lab step from working with the `GitLab` server - the one shown above is just an example. When you hit `enter` you will be challenged for the passphrase you used when you created your `ssh` key. Enter this passphrase and hit `enter`. Git will now clone (or copy) the remote project repository from your account on `GitLab` to a local repository in your account on `lumen.cs.mtech.edu` and link the two repositories, such that as you make changes to your local repository, you can `push` these changes back to the remote repository as needed, to update the shared (with your instructor and any TAs) repository on the `GitLab` server. 

Once the `clone` has completed, you should have a new (sub)directory in your `~/CSCI232/Labs` directory named `Lab06-ClassTypes`, which you can see by using the `ls` command. 

_Completing the Lab Activities_

As you work through the specific activities for this Lab, you will be asked questions, or to provide information from the environment. This information should be collected in a lab report in a file named `report.pdf` that you should include in the `Lab06-ClassTypes` directory. You may make this file in Microsoft Word and then save a copy in PDF format and upload (using `scp`) to your project folder. If you are unsure how to do this, ask the instructor or a TA. 

Please perform the following activities to complete this lab assignment: 

1. Once cloned, execute the `make` command to build the project, and then execute the resulting executable by executing `./driver` to make sure the project builds and executes correctly. 

1. Review and understand the provided code. Make sure you understand the syntax associated with the header and implementation files, with using templates, and with building the project - using the `make` command. 

1. Create a new box class named `BoxContainer` that inherits from `BoxInterface` and contains, through _composition_, any other box type, even another `BoxContainer`. 

1. Write recursive implementations for `setItem` and `getItem` that continue to open nested `BoxContainers` until the box is either a `MagicBox` or a `PlainBox` and then either _set_ or _get_ the item contained in the non-BoxContainer box. 

1. In your report, explain how you would use a `STACK ADT` to accomplish the same functionality as the recursive function `display` to accomplish the same behavior and provide pseduo code for a function that uses the `STACK ADT`. 

1. Modify the _driver_ program creates a series of Boxes, nests them, and then displays the contents. The provided `driver` program already has a start for you to accomplish this. 

1. Build and test your program using the `./driver` executable that gets built. Capture the output in a file `report.txt` and keep this file in the root of your lab directory.

14. Submit your finished project

    ```
    git add .  
    git commit -m 'please grade'  
    git push  
    ```

_Editing Your Lab Project Files_

You may edit your program files either locally, on the Linux system, or remotely, using any number of remote file system schemes. The method selected varies widely depending on your preference. 

To edit locally, on the Linux system, you should use either `nano` or `vim`. Both of these are powerful editors for working with different source code files. To edit a file with nano, you would type, 

```
nano driver.cpp
``` 

for example. You can follow the commands at the bottom of the `nano` window to manipulate the file. I have also included a cheat-sheet for `vim` if you would prefer to use that editor. 

If you are interested in remote editing your files, please see the instructor, a course TA, or a Museum Lab TA for assistance.
