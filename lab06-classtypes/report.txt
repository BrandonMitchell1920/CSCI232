The item in the box: Basketball
The item in the box: Volleyball

Let's nest a single box!  A PlainBox in a BoxContainer!
The original PlainBox holds Basketball and the PlainBox in a BoxContainer (1 level of nesting) holds a Basketball (should both be "Basketball")

Let's try setting the item of the PlainBox in the BoxContainer!
Calling setItem("Football") on the nested boxes!
Now the nested box holds a Football (should be "Football")

Let's try to nest our level 1 nested box into a couple of other BoxContainers!
Pass our box into the constructor of the BoxContainer to nest.
Let's try to display it's item!  It should still be "Football"
The PlainBox nested into three BoxContainers has a Football inside (should be "Football")
Does setItem() still work?  Let's change it to "Tennis Ball"!
The triple nested box holds a Tennis Ball (should be "Tennis Ball")

Final test!!!  Ten levels of nesting with a MagicBox!  The item should not change when set.
Initial item is Volleyball
The box still holds Volleyball (should be "Volleyball") and calling setItem("This shouldn's work!") on the box gives us Volleyball (should still be "Volleyball")
